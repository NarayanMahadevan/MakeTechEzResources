Below are the list of various BPM Projects that work across industry. Also the section below look at BPM Projects specically in [**Financial Service Industry**](#fin_serv_bpm). Note that typically all of them would involve in some form or the other Content or Document Lifecycle which involves Documentation, Document Processing Workflow and Collaboration across various department.

1. **Step: 1 Start with business value -** Successful process improvement initiatives start with business value. Its important to show real numbers like:

   a. Loan processing time was reduced by 40 percent   
   b. Each loan processor was able to successfully complete 25 percent more loans
   c. Loan Processing Department costs were reduced by 20 percent
   d. Loan Application over Internet doubled <p></p>
   
2. **Succeed with Short-term projects -** Process improvement initiatives must deliver quantifiable successes for stakeholder. By working on manageable project, one can deliver value to the business quickly, ensuring commitment, funding, and success of subsequent projects. Identifying Processes that will deliver quick results is very important. Such as

   a. Processes that have high Customer dissatisfaction
   b. Processes that huge Bottlenecks and where lot of pile-on of work happens
   c. Processes where improved efficiency quite obviously saves money
   d. Internal Processes where Employee Staisfaction can be improved
   e. Processes that can be easily streamlined, etc <p></p>3. **Extend process improvements -** Continously expand with short-term measurable BPM projects across the business. Leverage and sharing expertise along the way to truly build a process improvement program within the business.

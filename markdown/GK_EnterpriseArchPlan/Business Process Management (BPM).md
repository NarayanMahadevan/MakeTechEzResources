# What is BPM

**Business Process Management (BPM)** is an approach that’s designed to produce better processes through the combination of technology and business expertise. Its well know that Better Processes create value for the enterprise through growth, improved performance, better productivity, higher staff effectiveness, and better customer service. 

In a dynamic business environment, organizations need to be agile to respond to changes. BPM provides that agility by giving you more direct control over your operational processes. Practices such as Six Sigma and Lean Six Sigma as well asthe work done in quality control are fully incorporated in BPM methodology. 
BPM leverages software and services to provide total visibility into the organization. BPM Lifecycle involves Discovery of Business Processes, Documentation of Business Processes, Automation of Business Process, and continuous improvement of business processes to increase efficiency and reduce costs.

# Why BPM - Achieves *PDF*

At its core, BPM takes rigid, independent processes and transforms them into flexible, choreographed business services that work together to create substantial business value. This transformation help Organization to achieve **PDF** i.e. improved 

1. **Productivity -** process more for less effort, 
2. **Decion Making -** Automation of Decision Making Process and 
3. **Flexibility -** Change Business Processes and Decision Making in accordance to Market

# Typical BPM Projects

Content management, workflow, and collaboration capabilities between departments and across the enterprise are good choices for BPM projects relating to the authoring, assembly, distribution, and maintenance of documents. 
Content management, workflow, and collaboration capabilities are very appropriate when retention & records management are important parts of the business such as in litigation and compliance, audit support, etc. 
BPM solution makes good sense with content life cycle processes, document capture workflow, case management, and retention-sensitive processes.

Lets take a look at BPM for Financial Service Industry. Note that typically all of them would involve in some form or the other Content or Document Lifecycle which involves Documentation, Document Processing Workflow and Collaboration across various department.

**✓ &nbsp; [Financial Services](#fin_serv_bpm) -** Financial Services industry is burdened with regulatory compliance and huge investment on inflexible IT Systems. Yet requiring to keep competitive pace with the every changing market forces. Hence its required to have efficint processes and BPM implementation.

1. **New Client and Asset On-Boarding:** involves business processes to get Customer and asset on-board as they are critical for customer satisfaction and getting assets under management sooner so net fee income is increased.  

2. **Credit Request & Loan Origination:** Lending processes involves credit evaluation, underwriting, fulfillment, and monitoring between descrete department becomes an ideal candidate for BPM Project. 

3. **Regulatory Compliance:**  New regulations spawned in the wake of the financial meltdown are further complicating financial services operations and overburdening inflexible IT systems. BPM Project implementation will allow creating and integration applications which can easily adapt as more rules are specified and implemented.

4. **New Product Introduction:** Delivering new products to market is crucial for improving competitive differentiation and increasing market share in financial industries. BPM Projects will allow financial services industry accelerate the pace of introduction of new products.

1. **Step: 1 Start with business value -** Successful process improvement initiatives start with business value. Its important to show real numbers like:

   a. Loan processing time was reduced by 40 percent   
   b. Each loan processor was able to successfully complete 25 percent more loans
   c. Loan Processing Department costs were reduced by 20 percent
   d. Loan Application over Internet doubled <p></p>
   
2. **Succeed with Short-term projects -** Process improvement initiatives must deliver quantifiable successes for stakeholder. By working on manageable project, one can deliver value to the business quickly, ensuring commitment, funding, and success of subsequent projects. Identifying Processes that will deliver quick results is very important. Such as

   a. Processes that have high Customer dissatisfaction
   b. Processes that huge Bottlenecks and where lot of pile-on of work happens
   c. Processes where improved efficiency quite obviously saves money
   d. Internal Processes where Employee Staisfaction can be improved
   e. Processes that can be easily streamlined, etc <p></p>3. **Extend process improvements -** Continously expand with short-term measurable BPM projects across the business. Leverage and sharing expertise along the way to truly build a process improvement program within the business.

# Reasons for BPM Project failure

Any one of the following elements can spell disaster for your BPM project. Upfront planning needs to take each of these elements into account to ensure success.

1. Choosing the wrong project
2. Choosing the wrong process
3. Lack of proper communication
4. Lack of collaboration between the partners 
5. Ineffective coordination
6. Missing buy-in from a key player

####Design

Process Design encompasses both the identification of existing processes and the design of "to-be" processes. Areas of focus include representation of the process flow, the factors within it such as the processes, automations, the alerts & notifications, escalations, Standard Operating Procedures, Service Level Agreements, and task hand-over mechanisms. Mode details are covered in the following sections - [**Process Design**](#bpm_process_design), [**Business Rule Management**](#bpm_buss_rule), and [**Business Event Management**](#bpm_evnt_mgmt)

####Modeling  

Modeling takes the theoretical process design and introduces combinations of variables to check how business react to various conditions. In essense it involves running [**Process Simulations**](#bpm_prcs_simulation) for "what-if analysis" on the processes. 

####Execution  

For execution of BPM Project, its important to understand the required [**Specification for Implementation**](#bpm_impl) as discussed in Section below. The best way to execute BPM Projects is to use [BPM software vendors](#bpm_vendors). The [**Major Software Components**](#bpm_platform) that are required in a BPM Platform is discussed in a seperate section below.

####Monitoring  

Monitoring encompasses the tracking of individual processes, so that information on their state can be easily seen, and statistics on the performance of one or more processes can be provided. Business Process Monitoring and Business Analytics are key functionalities supported in End User Interface of BPM Software.

####Optimization

Process optimization includes retrieving process performance information from modeling or monitoring phase; identifying the potential or actual bottlenecks and the potential opportunities for cost savings or other improvements; and then, applying those enhancements in the design of the process. Overall, this creates greater business value.

# BPM Implementation Plan - Be *FASTER*

The basic operational value proposition of BPM is the ability to process more with less effort and higher quality. BPM pervades through the organization and it caters to both Structured or Well-defined processes or Un-structured or Highly dynamic process

BPM implementation with-in an organization is all about being **FASTER** as shown in figure below:

1. Create **FLow Charts** for different process for faster decision making.
2. Build **Automation** using solid Business Rules for different activities in the flow chart. Automation of high-volume operational decisions helps in quick decision making in a highly repeatable and consistent manner. 
3. **Specify Processes** to be seen in action wholistically as wells as in a drill-down manner and to see how decisions affect the  bottom line. 
4. Select appropriate **Tools** for Business Process Improvements.
   
6. Define **Events** for error reporting, status reporting, reporting of bottlenecks, etc seamlessly to corresponding stake holders in realtime.
7. Create **Reports** to show Business Value with respect to  
   a. Minimization of time spent of different activities with-in process, 
   b. Maximization of the use of resources, and 
   c. Reduction of waste to an absolute minimum.

-->

As can be seen in the figure the folllwoing are some of the major software components that make up BPM Platform. 
1. **End User Components** include 
   a. **Web UI -** Workspace Component for process monitoring, management dashboards, and task inboxes. 

   b. **Enterprise Mobility -** Mobile interface enabling the right employees, access to key business processes, tasks, data, and reports realtime on-the-go.

   c. **Collaboration Tools —** Effective communication both intra- and inter departmental through discussion forums, dynamic workspaces, and message boards
2. An **Execution Environment Components** which includes 

   a. **Workflow Processor** is the execution of Process Model where in the Business Process Engine executes individual process and Business Rule Engine execute the logicflow between the processes. 

   b. **Business Process Engine** responsibility is to execute individual processes with-in the Business Process Model. Each Business Process has a defined implementation that may be a human task, an automated step, a business rule, a business systems across the enterprise, or external business system

   c. **Business Rules Engine** to execute Business Rules and automate the decision making process. More details in Business Rule Management.

   d. **Business Event Processor** to send, receive and process message events for asynchronous process communication. Business Event Processor enables an organization to set Rules and Timers to detect and send events taking place during the execution of the Business Process Model as well as receive and process messages to trigger relevant business processes. More details in Business Event Processing.

   e. **Analytics Engine** This helps in **Predictive Analytics** to create prediction models for future process activities, real-time analysis and reporting for up to tens of millions of active process instances, and **Postmortem Analytics** of process models to view inefficiencies and bottlenecks measured against key performance indicators (KPIs). <p></p>

3. **Designer Toolbox** that enables process modeling, business rule definition, event specifications, definition of  key performance indicators (KPI’s), process development, and design of user interfaces

4. **Metadata Repository** that contains process repository, rules and events repositiory. For appropriate management of repository, its importatnt that BPM platform supports version control, hierarchical categorization, search, and role-based security for controlled access.

5. <a name="bpm_prcs_simulation"/></a>**Process Simulation -** This component allows to test your processes before going live with them. Its also usesful to run the processes through what-if scenarios for adjustments and fine-tuning of the model. Process simulation is one of the iterative steps in the development of an effective BPM system. Typically the importance is discovered by analyzing the results of the simulation, making necessary changes, and rerunning the simulation — possibly several times.
6. **Document Management** component provides a system for storing and securing electronic documents, images, and other files. Full text search and quick content filters ensure one can quickly find key documents to share in processes and tasks. Version Control, Sharing, Document Genaration, Mobile Access, etc are other key features of Document Management System.
7. **Integration Component** that integrates easily using SOA, Web Services, Messaging Systems, etc to enterprise systems as well as external systems. This is important to protect the investments done by enterprise on Technology Assets and leverage them to create an Integrated BPM Solution.

# Process Design

In the BPM environment, process design and definition occurs within a graphical environment. Most BPM development tools are a standard modeling notation — essentially, a simplified programming language — to define the process model. Typically, either Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) or XML Process Definition Language (XPDL) is used. Essentially, a process design looks very much like a flowchart wherein the **Business Processes** are the boxes in the flowchart, and the **Business Rules** define the logic flow through the flowchart.  

1. Each **Business Process** has a defined implementation that may be a human task, an automated step, a business rule, a business systems across the enterprise, or external business system. 

2. **Business rules** are at the heart of a BPM project. These rules are the policies and procedures that automate the business process. Essentially Business rules govern workflow routing within a BPM process.

<a name="bpm_buss_rule"/></a>
# Business Rule Management

The basic operational value proposition of BPM is the ability to process more for less effort with higher predictatbility and consistency. To achieve this automation of high value Operational Decision is the must. This Decisions are based on Business Rules that are based on policies and procedures as well as derived from current Business Analytics and future Predictive Analytics.  

Business Rules are essentially conditional statements and are used for a variety purposes with-in Business Process Management. They are:

1. Process Initialization and Prioritizations
2. Routing Decisions
3. Setting alerts and triggers
4. Determine Business Outcome

Using Software for Business Rules Management, allows clear seperation of Business Rules from Application Code. This essentially means Business Owners can define and manage the decision logic, reducing the amount of time and effort required to update that logic in production systems. Thus enhancing the organization’s ability to respond to changes in the business environment. Essential **Components** of Business Rule Management Software are:

1. **Rules Repository -** Rules are stored in Hierarchical Manner with version control and ability to role back. 

2. **Rules Designer -** To create rules that support complex decisions, data transformations, global constants, and data queries. 

3. **Rules Validator -** Validate rules before publishing using Process Simulation.

4. **Rules Executer -** To execute Business Rules Engine to execute Rules real-time during Process Execution.  The outcome of Rules Exceution could be Process Initialization, Process Routing, Alerts and Triggers, or Business Outcome.

<a name="bpm_evnt_mgmt"/></a>
# Business Event Management

Business Events are events that are triggered during the execution Business Processes or are messages that are processed comming from external sources or systems. Business Events occour real time to facilitate situational awareness and response. 

Types of Event Supported are 

1. **Timer Events -** Timer Events are based on Events that are triggered on Set Date and Time or the Events that are triggered after particular delay. Timer Events can be also be rule based. Timer Events trigger processes, notifications or other events, etc in a Business Process Management System.

2. **Rule Based Events -** These events are triggered based on the execution of Business Rule. As any other events Rule Based Events also triggers Asynchronous Process Communication.

3. **Message Events -** Message Events are events that are detected, received or intercepted by Event Processor and processed based on rules enabling automated decision making. Message events can be unstructured data such as client letters and communications, emails, policies, media attachments, event feeds, social networking feeds, and a range of real-time collaboration tools.

# BPM Software Vendors

Here is a brief overview of some of the Software Vendors who offer BPM Platform as their Product and Solution Offerring. Here 3 prominint BPM solution providers are studied at a high level. The intention is to pull out salient points of each solution, rather than to provide an exhaustive, in-depth analysis of each solution. 

1. [**Appian BPM**](#appian) 
2. [**Oracle BPM**](#oracle) 
3. [**IBM BPM**](#ibm)

<a name="appian"/></a>
# Appian BPM

Appian is one of the new players on the BPM block. Founded in 1999, it has only just finished its first decade, but in this time it has established itself as a pure play BPM solution provider. Common themes running through all Appian’s offerings are the 100% browser-based nature. It provides solution for on-premise as-well-ass cloud deployment. The Appian BPM Suite consists of a whole range of different functions and components, but with a few exceptions they all come in a single package. The single package includes all the associated capabilities such as process design, business rules, events, content management, monitoring, analytics and mobile clients. Here are some of the functional points that Appian offers:

1. For process modelling, Appian offers **Appian Process Modeler** which is a 100% web-based tool supporting BPMN-style process flow design and specification.

2. Appian BPM offers **Role-based Security** for controlled access and **Full Versioning** for controlled change and **Role-back** capabilities to just about everything. Thus Rules, processes, smart services, document – all can be versioned to manage change effectively with controlled access. 

3. Appian’s support for **Business Rules and Business Events** is also built into the single-package Appian BPM Suite. Rules and events are specified through a web-based menu-style interface, and can be validated before deployment. The rules and events are stored in a proprietary language in the Appian repository.

4. Appian offers two routes to handling user interface needs – forms and portals
   a. **Forms -** The Appian Forms Designer is a web-based tool that provides a menu-driven means of building a user interface display. Appian Forms Designer also supports the ability to map PDF, HTML and JSP format forms to Appian BPM forms. Once the Appian form is built, it is stored as an artefact and can now be drag and dropped as required into the process flow. 
   b. **Portals -** Portal support is more applicable to the idea of providing a user or role with a personalized workspace. Portal dashboards are built using a point and click style of interface under a web-based tool. <p></p>

5. Appian BPM Suite supports **Document Management** in conjunction with its BPM processes. Documents can be stored and tagged with metadata and tied to a particular processes, and are then available for other process participants to review as required. 

6. For use in a **Mobile Environment**, Appian offers support for iPhone/iPad, Blackberry and Android clients, providing native client applications to interact with the processes. A particularly useful feature is that the user interface only needs to be designed once and is then automatically rendered for each mobile device. If third parties want to create their own implementations for other mobile devices then Appian offers a full branding package too.

7. For **Monitoring and Executive Dashboards**, Appian BPM Suite has a Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) component for monitoring process execution and an **in-memory analytics engine** that can be used in-flight to analyse process execution instances in real time. 

8. Appian BPM Suite includes a process execution engine that handles all the runtime needs of the processes. Appian is built to run in a Java J2EE application server environment; Appian packages its BPM suite with JBoss, but can also run on WebSphere and WebLogic platforms. SOA and web services integration needs are handled through the **Appian Smart Services**. Appian repository uses either Oracle RDBMS or SQL Server. 

Here are the pros and cons of Appian BPM Offerrings -

1. The fact that all tools are **100% web-based**, hence it offers a level of usability because it provides consistency and accessibility.

2. Appian BPM Suite offers all the major functionality in a **Single Package** which includes process design, business rules, events, document management, monitoring, analytics and mobile clients.

3. The biggest time-to-value contributor offered by Appian BPM Suite is the support for **Social BPM**. Once the process has been defined and the user interfaces set up, the collaborative nature of process interaction combined with the ease of access from within social networking feeds or through the packaged mobile native clients makes getting end users up to speed and productive much easier and quicker. 
4. **Versioning** is a strong point for the product though. With Appian BPM Suite, just about everything can be versioned, with roll-back capabilities and role or user-based security to control access. Security is fairly standard, with role and user-based authorization and SSL to secure communications.

5. **Dynamic update** is another strong point of Appian BPM Suite. Not only can processes be changed in-flight, but individual executions of the process can be changed dynamically without affecting the way the process runs next time. Further the combination of in-memory analytics tool that can produce information in real time which can then be used to dynamically change operations makes it very powerful.

6. **Limited Adapters to commercial applications** - Appian BPM only offers a fairly basic range of adapters, covering such applications as major ERP or CRM packages. It does offer Java-based data access services for bringing data into the processes for enrichment or reference purposes, but beyond this there is not much on offer to ease integration with other commercial applications and environments. 

7. **Limited support for Import / export capabilities -** Import / export is relatively limited area of functionality mainly available to user interface and reports. Its limited because Appian has taken proprietary approach to use its own language for rules specification. Further Appiean does not support other external Busines Rule Mnagament System (BRMS), Business Event Processing (BEP), BAM or Analytics tools, and Appian artefacts cannot be exported to other tools either.

8. Appian BPM Suite relies on its underlying host environments for **Scalability** as it runs on most major Java enterprise application servers. The biggest contribution to performance comes from in-memory analytics engine, but this in itself raises concerns over scalability as they start to struggle when systems get too heavily loaded.

9. **Limited Process Templates -** Appian does limited supply of process templates to cover specific needs of its prime Federal Government market, targeted at HR and Accounting needs. These Process Template Packages significantly speed up solution deployment and value creation.

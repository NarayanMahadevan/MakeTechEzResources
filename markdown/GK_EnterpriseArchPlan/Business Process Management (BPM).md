This part is a quick introduction of Business Process Management. This part not only defines BPM in a simplified manner but also takes you through typical BPM Projects and BPM Roadmap. In its simplest form, BPM is software that enables you to automate, execute and monitor business processes from beginning to end by connecting people, applications and data. BPM takes rigid, independent processes and transforms them into flexible, choreographed business services that work together to create substantial business value. This transformation help Organization to achieve **PDF i.e. Productivity, Decision Making and Flexibility**.

</br>
<a name="define_bpm"/></a>
### Define BPM
</br>
**Business Process Management (BPM)** is an approach that’s designed to produce better processes through the combination of technology and business expertise. Its well know that Better Processes create value for the enterprise through growth, improved performance, better productivity, higher staff effectiveness, and better customer service.
In a dynamic business environment, organisations need to be agile to respond to changes. BPM provides that agility by giving you more direct control over your operational processes. Practices such as Six Sigma and Lean Six Sigma as well as the work done in quality control are fully incorporated in BPM methodology.
BPM leverages software and services to provide total visibility into the organization. BPM Lifecycle involves Discovery of Business Processes, Documentation of Business Processes, Automation of Business Process, and continuous improvement of business processes to increase efficiency and reduce costs.

</br>
<a name="why_bpm"/></a>
### Why BPM?………… Achieves *PDF*
</br>
At its core, BPM takes rigid, independent processes and transforms them into flexible, choreographed business services that work together to create substantial business value. This transformation help Organization to achieve **PDF** which is 

1. Improved **P**roductivity - process more for less effort, 
2. Improved **D**ecision Making - Automation of Decision Making Process and 
3. Improved **F**lexibility - Change Business Processes and Decision Making in accordance to Market

<a name="bpm_projects"/></a>
## Typical BPM Projects
</br>
Content management, workflow, and collaboration capabilities between departments and across the enterprise are good choices for BPM projects relating to the authoring, assembly, distribution, and maintenance of documents. 
Content management, workflow, and collaboration capabilities are very appropriate when retention & records management are important parts of the business such as in litigation and compliance, audit support, etc. 
BPM solution makes good sense with content life cycle processes, document capture workflow, case management, and retention-sensitive processes. Below are the list of various BPM Projects that work across industry. Also the section below looks at BPM Projects specially in [**Financial Service Industry**](#fin_serv_bpm). Note that typically all of them would involve in some form or the other Content or Document Lifecycle which involves Documentation, Document Processing Workflow and Collaboration across various department.

1. **Cross-sell, Up-sell and Personalized Messaging:** At various customer touch points be it on telephone, internet, mobile app, email, or postal mail, maximize opportunities through targeted offering and loyalty through personalize messaging. BPM Project makes it possible through use of Customer Data, Business Rule Automation and BPM Adapters to integrate with Enterprise Systems.

2. **New Product Introduction:** Delivering new products to market is crucial for improving competitive differentiation and increasing market share. BPM for New Product Introduction Process involves managing all activities and resources from Marketing, Legal, R&D, Supply Chain, Warehousing, Sales and Distribution etc to bring a new product to market in a streamlined and predictable manner.

3. **Fraud prevention and detection:** Tracking events, correlating event patterns and executing automated risk assessments enable companies to take a proactive approach to identifying and stopping claims fraud, money laundering schemes, mobile device hacking, phishing scams, meter or other equipment tampering, and identity theft.

4. **Sales & Distribution -** BPM makes process easier for opening up new sales channels, introducing new product, boosting the sales and distribution partners with relevant information and case study. 

5. **Customer Acquisition -** Success in this arena requires getting an appropriate product in front of the right customer at the right time, without breaking any rules or regulation. BPM software can provide integrated analytics combined with an optimized process framework, that enable customer acquisition campaign managers to make better, faster decisions that increase outcomes.

6. **Lightweight processes**	 common in many companies for handling relatively simple activities such as on-boarding a new employee, booking travel, customer feedbacks, customer satisfaction survey, etc. are ideal for BPM Projects.  

#  
<a name="fin_serv_bpm"/></a>
### BPM Projects in Financial Services
</br>
BPM Processes can be effectively used from the way customers are acquired, on-boarded and serviced, to the speed with which new products are brought to market, and the means by which financial firms assess risk and ensure compliance across the lifetime of a customer. 

</br>
#### New Customer and Asset On-Boarding 
</br>
**Business Process:** This involves business processes to get Customer and asset on-board as they are critical for customer satisfaction and getting assets under management sooner so net fee income is increased. 

**Business Need:** A strong process for Customer and Asset On-boarding is not only critical for efficiently ramping new customers to profitability, but increasingly to deal with stringent compliance requirements such as  Know Your Customer (KYC) and other risk management requirements. Inefficient or incomplete processes in this arena increase the risk of non-compliance. They also create negative customer perception. 

**BPM Solution:** 

1. A BPM suite can drive a customer-centric on-boarding experience that creates a strong positive first impression. 
2. Visibility into activities and their status can be shared not only with employees to increase efficiency, but directly with customers as well, bringing them into the process and keeping them informed of any information they need to supply, next steps, and ultimate resolution.       

#  
#### Financial Case Management 
</br>
**Business Process:** This involves managing individual cases which essentially are customer interaction points such as customer support issue, Credit Request, up-sell new financial products, etc.

**Business Need:** The successful resolution of a customer support issue or closing a sales opportunity can be accelerated if all pertinent interactions and documentation are easily accessible via a case folder. 

**BPM Solution:** 

1. A BPM platform with an integrated content management system will allow integration of all customer interactions and related documents across all products. 
2. Alert and escalation capabilities  as well as Comprehensive analytics and reporting capabilities with-in in the BPM platform can help keeping customer satisfaction index high, manage regulatory compliance and successful positioning of new products     

<a name="bpm_roadmap"/></a>
## High level BPM Roadmap - Just *BSE*
</br>Successful BPM implementation is essentially an Agile Development Methodology consisting of many small iterations. Each iteration are short-term well defined goals achieving clear business values. Typical roadmap of BPM is as shown in figure below.
</br>  
![Roadmap of BPM][1]

-->
</br>  

**Step: 1 Start with business value -** Successful process improvement initiatives start with business value. Its important to show real numbers like:

a. Loan processing time was reduced by 40 percent   
b. Each loan processor was able to successfully complete 25 percent more loans
c. Loan Processing Department costs were reduced by 20 percent
d. Loan Application over Internet doubled </br>
   
**Step: 2 Succeed with Short-term projects -** Process improvement initiatives must deliver quantifiable successes for stakeholder. By working on manageable project, one can deliver value to the business quickly, ensuring commitment, funding, and success of subsequent projects. Identifying Processes that will deliver quick results is very important. Such as :-

a. Processes that have high Customer dissatisfaction
b. Processes that have huge Bottlenecks and where lot of pile-on of work happens
c. Processes that are heavily manual and where efficient process handling can save money
d. Internal Processes where Employee Satisfaction can be improved
e. Processes that can be easily streamlined, etc </br>**Step: 3 Extend process improvements -** It is important to continuously expand with short-term measurable BPM projects across the business. Leverage and share experience along the way to truly build a process improvement program within the business.

<a name="bpm_proj_failure"/></a>
## Reasons for BPM Project failure
</br>
Any one of the following elements can spell disaster for your BPM project. Upfront planning needs to take each of these elements into account to ensure success.

1. Choosing the wrong project
2. Choosing the wrong process
3. Lack of proper communication
4. Lack of collaboration between the partners 
5. Ineffective coordination
6. Missing buy-in from a key player

[Part2]: https://raw.github.com/NarayanMahadevan/MakeTechEzResources/master/images/GK_EnterpriseArchPlan/GK_BPM_Part2.png "BPM Lifecycle and Implementation"     
-->
</br>  

This part takes through the BPM Lifecycle and typical implementation plan of a BPM project. BPM Lifecycle can be grouped into Design, Modeling, Execution, Monitoring, and Optimization. BPM implementation plan with-in an organization is all about being **FASTER** i.e. creating **Flow Charts** for Business Processes, **Automation** of highly operational processes, **Specifying** the Live Processes, selecting appropriate **Tools**, **Event Processing** based on Business Rules, and finally **Reports** mainly Postmortem and Predictive Analytics to improve Business Process.

<a name="bpm_lifecycle"/></a>
### BPM Lifecycle
</br>
Business Process Management can be grouped into Design, Modeling, Execution, Monitoring, and Optimization as seen in the figure. 

####Design

Process Design encompasses both the identification of existing processes and the design of "to-be" processes. Areas of focus include representation of the process flow, the factors within it. The factors to be considered for process flow include the processes, automations, the alerts & notifications, escalations, Standard Operating Procedures, Service Level Agreements, and task hand-over mechanisms. Mode details are covered in the following sections - [**Process Design**](#bpm_process_design), [**Business Rule Management**](#bpm_buss_rule), and [**Business Event Management**](#bpm_evnt_mgmt)

</br>  
![BPM Process Lifecycle][3]

-->
</br>  

####Modeling  

Modeling takes the theoretical process design and introduces combinations of variables to check how business react to various conditions. In essence it involves running [**Process Simulations**](#bpm_prcs_simulation) for "what-if analysis" on the processes. </br></br>

####Execution  

For execution of BPM Project, its important to understand the required [**Specification for Implementation**](#bpm_impl) as discussed in following section. The best way to execute BPM Projects is to use [BPM software vendors](#bpm_vendors). The [**Major Software Components**](#bpm_platform) that are required in a BPM Platform is discussed in a separate section.

#  
####Monitoring  

Monitoring encompasses the tracking of individual processes, so that information on their state can be easily seen, and statistics on the performance of one or more processes can be provided. Business Process Monitoring and Business Analytics are key functionalities supported in End User Interface of BPM Software. </br></br>

####Optimization

Process optimization includes retrieving process performance information from modeling or monitoring phase; identifying the potential or actual bottlenecks and the potential opportunities for cost savings or other improvements; and then, applying those enhancements in the design of the process. Overall, this creates greater business value. 

</br>
<a name="bpm_impl"/></a>
### BPM Implementation Plan - Be *FASTER*
</br>
The basic operational value proposition of BPM is the ability to process more with less effort and higher quality. BPM pervades through the organization and it caters to both Structured or Well-defined processes or Un-structured or Highly dynamic process

BPM implementation with-in an organization is all about being **FASTER** as shown in figure below:

</br>  
![BPM Implementation][2]

[2]: /Users/narayan/Documents/MakeTechEzResources/images/GK_EnterpriseArchPlan/BPMImpl.png "BPM Implementation"  
<!--
[2]: https://raw.github.com/NarayanMahadevan/MakeTechEzResources/master/images/GK_EnterpriseArchPlan/BPMImpl.png "BPM Implementation"     
-->
</br>  

For any BPM Implementation you need to do the following:
1. Create **FLow Charts** for different process for faster decision making.
2. Build **Automation** using solid Business Rules for different activities in the flow chart. Automation of high-volume operational decisions helps in quick decision making in a highly repeatable and consistent manner. 
3. **Specify Processes** to be seen in action holistically as well as in a drill-down manner and to see how decisions affect the  bottom line. 
4. Select appropriate **Tools** for Business Process Improvements.
   
6. Define **Events** for error reporting, status reporting, reporting of bottlenecks, etc seamlessly to corresponding stake holders in realtime.
7. Create **Reports** to show Business Value with respect to  
   a. Minimization of time spent on different activities with-in a process, 
   b. Maximization of the use on resources, and 
   c. Reduction of waste to an absolute minimum.

</br>  

This part covers major software components that make-up the BPM Platform. The BPM mainly consists of End User Components used by Process Participants, Process Designers and Engineers, Runtime Execution Components like Process Execution, Business Rules Execution, Event Processor and Analytics Engine, Integration Components, Document Management Component, etc. Later part of section discusses in detail BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) Standard for business process modeling.

There are 3 kinds of users for a BPM Suite. They are :-

1. **Business People -** Their role is to use the Process Modelling Tool for incorporating Business Processes. Further they use the Design tool to create forms and user interface for Process Participants. 
2. **Technical People -** They collaborate with Business people to design a BPM flow, integration activities, simulation and the deployment of the process design.
3. **Process Participants -** Their role is real-time process monitoring and participate in the execution os process task.

<a name="bpm_platform"/></a>
## Major Components in BPM Software
</br>
The figure below shows high-level overview of BPM Platform. </br> 
![BPM Software Components][4]

[4]: /Users/narayan/Documents/MakeTechEzResources/images/GK_EnterpriseArchPlan/BPMSystem.png "BPM Software Components"  
<!--
[4]: https://raw.github.com/NarayanMahadevan/MakeTechEzResources/master/images/GK_EnterpriseArchPlan/BPMSystem.png "BPM Software Components"     
-->
</br>  

As can be seen in the figure the following are some of the major software components that make up BPM Platform. 
</br>
#### Process Participant Components 

This include :-
1. **Web UI -** This is the Workspace Component for process monitoring, management dashboards, and task inboxes. Further this helps Process Participants to track process trends, show bottlenecks and make suggestions for dealing with bottlenecks.

2. **Enterprise Mobility -** This is the Mobile interface that enables employees secured access to key business processes, tasks, data, and reports in realtime and  on-the-go.

3. **Collaboration Tools —** Facilitates effective communication for both intra- and inter departmental, through discussion forums, dynamic workspaces, and message boards.
#### Execution Environment Components

This include :-
1. **Workflow Processor** is the execution of Process Model where in the Business Process Engine executes individual process and Business Rule Engine executes the logic flow between the processes. The workflow engine is the key to building a process management application that will organize, control and monitor the work on every process during the execution of a process instance. 

2. **Business Process Engine's** responsibility is to execute individual processes with-in the Business Process Model. Each Business Process has a defined implementation that may be a human task, an automated step, a business rule, a business systems across the enterprise, or external business system.

3. **Business Rules Engine** helps to execute Business Rules and automates the decision making process. Essentially it examines the rules in response to process events and makes decisions about how the process should proceed. More details provided in Business Rule Management.

4. **Business Event Processor** is used to send, receive and process message events for asynchronous process communication. Business Event Processor enables an organization to set Rules and Timers to detect and send events taking place during the execution of the Business Process Model as well as receive and process messages to trigger relevant business processes. More details in Business Event Processing.

5. **Analytics Engine** assists in **Predictive Analytics** to create prediction models for future process activities, real-time analysis and reporting. Analytics Engine is also useful for **Postmortem Analytics** of process models to view inefficiencies and bottlenecks measured against key performance indicators (KPIs). 

#### Designer Toolbox

Designer Toolbox enables process modeling, business rule definition, event specifications, definition of  key performance indicators (KPI’s), process development, and design of user interfaces. Most BPM Vendors have separate  designer tool for Business People and Technical People.</br></br>

#### Process Monitoring Tool

Process Monitoring Tool is part of designer tool to generate the monitoring models necessary for run-time monitoring of BPM processes together with reporting and analysis facilities, executive dashboards, etc.</br></br>

#### Metadata Repository

Metadata Repository that contains process repository, rules and events repository. For appropriate management of repository, its important that BPM platform supports version control, hierarchical categorization, search, and role-based security for controlled access.

#  
<a name="bpm_prcs_simulation"/></a>
#### Process Simulation

Process Simulation component allows to test your processes before going live with them. Its also useful to run the processes through what-if scenarios for adjustments and fine-tuning of the model. Process simulation is one of the iterative steps in the development of an effective BPM system. Typically the importance is discovered by analyzing the results of the simulation, making necessary changes, and rerunning the simulation — possibly several times.</br></br>
#### Document Management
Document Management component provides a system for storing and securing electronic documents, images, and other files. Full text search and quick content filters ensure one can quickly find key documents to share in processes and tasks. Version Control, Sharing, Document Generation, Mobile Access, etc are other key features of Document Management System.</br></br>

#### Integration Component
Integration Component that integrates easily using SOA, Web Services, Messaging Systems, etc to enterprise systems as well as external systems. This is important to protect the investments done by enterprise on Technology Assets and leverage them to create an Integrated BPM Solution.   
<a name="bpm_process_design"/></a>
## Process Design
</br>
In the BPM environment, process design and definition occurs within a graphical environment. Most BPM development tools are based on standard modeling notation — either Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) or XML Process Definition Language (XPDL). Essentially, a process design looks very much like a flowchart wherein the **Business Processes** are the boxes in the flowchart, and the **Business Rules** define the logic flow through the flowchart.  

1. Each **Business Process** has a defined implementation that may be a human task, an automated step, a business rule, a business systems across the enterprise, or external business system. 

2. **Business rules** are at the heart of a BPM project. These rules are the policies and procedures that automate the business process. Essentially Business rules govern workflow routing within a BPM process.

<a name="bpmn_std"/></a>
### BPMN Standards and Definition
</br>
Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a standard for business process modeling that provides a graphical notation for specifying business processes in a Business Process Diagram (BPD) based on a flowcharting technique. 

The objective of BPMN is to support business process management, for both technical users and business users, by providing a notation that is intuitive to business users, yet able to represent complex process semantics. 

The BPMN specification also provides a mapping between the graphics of the notation and the underlying constructs for execution, particularly Business Process Execution Language (BPEL).</br>
</br>
### BPMN Elements
</br>
BPMN models consist of simple diagrams constructed from a limited set of graphical elements. For both business users and developers, they simplify understanding business activities flow and process. BPMN's four basic element categories are:

1. [**Flow Objects**](#bpmn_flow_objects)
2. [**Connecting Objects**](#bpmn_connecting_objects)
3. [**Swimlanes**](#bpmn_swim_lanes)
4. [**Artifacts**](#bpmn_artifacts)</br>

#  
<a name="bpmn_flow_objects"/></a>
###Flow objects 
</br>
Flow objects are the main describing elements within BPMN, and consist of three core elements:

1. [**Events**](#bpmn_events)
2. [**Activities**](#bpmn_activities)
3. [**Gateways**](#bpmn_gateways)</br> 

<a name="bpmn_events"/></a>
#### Events
</br>
Events are anything that "happens" during the course of a business process. Events can be a Process Trigger and/or a Process Result. Events are also classified as Catching (for example, if catching an incoming message starts a process) or Throwing (such as throwing a completion message when a process ends). 

An Event is represented by a circle in a Business Process Model. There are three types of Events based on when they occur in the flow of a process - **Start, Intermediate, and End** represented as 

&nbsp;&nbsp;![Event Notation][img_bpmn_event]

-->
</br>
<a name="bpmn_activities"/></a>
#### Activities
</br>
An activity is any work that is being performed in a process. An Activity is represented by a rounded-corner rectangle in a Business Process Model. Activity can be a Task or a Sub-process. Sub-process can be either Transaction or Call Activity as shown in the figure below :-

</br>
<a name="bpmn_gateways"/></a>
#### Gateways
</br>
A Gateway is used to control the flow of a process. Gateways handle the forking, merging and joining of paths within a process. Gateways are represented by a diamond shape in a Business Process Model. Gateways can be any of the following types as shown in the figure below :-

![Event Notation][img_bpmn_gateway]

-->

1. **Exclusive -** Takes only one of the many paths. 
2. **Event Based -** The path is based on evaluated event.
3. **Parallel -** Used to create parallel paths without evaluating any conditions.
4. **Inclusive -**  Used to create alternative flows where all paths are evaluated.
5. **Exclusive Event Based -** The exclusive path to be taken is based on an evaluated event.
6. **Complex -** used for complex synchronization.
7. **Parallel Event Based -**Parallel process are started based on an event without any evaluation.

#  
<a name="bpmn_connecting_objects"/></a>
###Connecting objects 
</br>
Flow Objects are connected together using Connecting Objects. There are three types of Connecting Objects as shown in figure :-

1. **Sequence flow -** Sequence Flow is used to show the order in which activities of a process will be performed. It is represented with a solid line and a solid arrowhead.
2. **Message flow** Message Flow is used to show the flow of messages between process participants during a process. It is represented with a dashed line and an open arrowhead.
3. **Association -** An Association is used to show relationships between data, text and other Artifacts and flow objects in a process. It is represented by a dotted line.

###Swimlanes 
</br>
Swimlanes serve as a mechanism to organize activities and responsibilities on a process diagram. There are two objects used in this organization - Pools and Lanes.

1. **Pool -** A Pool represents a participant in a process. Pools are used when a process has multiple participants or business entities. The activities in a Pool are a self-contained process. Sequence Flow cannot cross Pool lines. 
2. **Lanes -** A Lane is a sub-partition within a Pool. Sequence Flow can cross the lines of a Lane. However, it is not accepted to have Message Flow crossing between objects in Lanes of the same pool.

###Artifacts
</br>
Artifacts allow developers to bring some more information into the model/diagram. In this way the model/diagram becomes more readable. There are three pre-defined Artifacts and they are Data Objects, Group and Annotation. The notation of these artifacts are shown in the figure below :-

1. **Data object -** Data objects show the reader which data is required or produced in an activity.
2. **Group -** A Group is used to document the grouping of any type of process objects. Groupings can cross lanes as needed. Groupings are represented by a rounded rectangle with a dashed line.
3. **Annotation -** Annotations can be used to add textual comments within a process diagram.

## Business Rule Management
</br>
The basic operational value proposition of BPM is the ability to process more for less effort with higher predictability and consistency. To achieve this, automation of high value Operational Decision is a must. This Decisions are based on Business Rules that are based on policies and procedures as well as derived from current Business Analytics and future Predictive Analytics.  

Business Rules are essentially conditional statements and are used for a variety of purposes with-in Business Process Management. They are:

1. Process Initialization and Prioritizations
2. Routing Decisions
3. Setting alerts and triggers
4. Determine Business Outcome

Using Software for Business Rules Management, allows clear separation of Business Rules from Application Code. This essentially means Business Owners can define and manage the decision logic, reducing the amount of time and effort required to update that logic in production systems. Thus enhancing the organization’s ability to respond to changes in the business environment. Essential **Components** of Business Rules Management Software are :-

1. **Rules Repository -** Rules are stored in Hierarchical Manner with version control and ability to role back. 

2. **Rules Designer -** To create rules that support complex decisions, data transformations, global constants, and data queries. 

3. **Rules Validator -** Validate rules before publishing using Process Simulation.

4. **Rules Executer -** Executes Business Rules real-time during Process Execution.  The outcome of Rules Execution could be Process Initialization, Process Routing, Alerts and Triggers, or Business Outcome.

<a name="bpm_evnt_mgmt"/></a>
### Business Event Management
</br>
Business Events are events that are triggered during the execution of Business Processes or are messages that are processed coming from external sources or systems. Business Events occur real time to facilitate situational awareness and response. 

Types of Event Supported are :-

1. **Timer Events -** Timer Events are based on Events that are triggered on Set Date and Time or the Events that are triggered after particular delay. Timer Events can be also be rule based. Timer Events trigger processes, notifications or other events, etc in a Business Process Management System.

2. **Rule Based Events -** These events are triggered based on the execution of Business Rule. Like any other events, Rule Based Events also triggers Asynchronous Process Communication.

3. **Message Events -** Message Events are events that are detected, received or intercepted by Event Processor and processed based on rules enabling automated decision making. Message events can be unstructured data such as client letters and communications, emails, policies, media attachments, event feeds, social networking feeds, etc.

# BPM Software Vendors
-->

Here is a brief overview of some of the Software Vendors who offer BPM Platform as their Product and Solution Offering. Here 3 prominent BPM solution providers are studied at a high level. The intention is to pull out salient points of each solution, rather than to provide an exhaustive, in-depth analysis of each solution. 
The following write up is purely the author's opinion and the readers are expected to do their own due deligence.

1. [**Appian BPM**](#appian) 
2. [**Oracle BPM**](#oracle) 
3. [**IBM BPM**](#ibm)
4. [**Summary**](#bpm_vendors_summary)

<a name="appian"/></a>
## Appian BPM
</br>
Appian BPM suite is 100% browser based Offering. It provides solution for on-premise as-well-as cloud deployment. The Appian BPM Suite consists of a whole range of different functions and components in a single package. The single package includes all the associated capabilities such as process design, business rules, events, content management, monitoring, analytics and mobile clients. Here are some of the functional points that Appian offers :-

1. **Appian Process Modeler** is a process modelling web-based tool supporting BPMN-style process flow design and specification.

2. Appian BPM offers **Role-based Security** for controlled access and **Full Versioning** for controlled change and **Role-back** capabilities to just about everything. Thus Rules, processes, smart services, document – all can be versioned to manage change effectively with controlled access. 

3. Appian BPM Suite supports **Business Rules and Business Events** through a web-based menu-style interface, and can be validated before deployment. The rules and events are stored in a proprietary language in the Appian repository.

4. Appian offers two routes to handling user interface needs – forms and portals
   a. **Forms -** The Appian Forms Designer is a web-based tool that provides a menu-driven means of building a user interface display. Appian Forms Designer also supports the ability to map PDF, HTML and JSP format forms to Appian BPM forms. Once the Appian form is built, it is stored as an artefact and can now be drag and dropped as required into the process flow. 
   b. **Portals -** Portal solution is more applicable for providing a user or role with a personalized workspace. Portal dashboards are built using a point and click style of interface under a web-based tool. <p></p>

5. Appian BPM Suite supports **Document Management** in conjunction with its BPM processes. Documents can be stored and tagged with metadata and tied to a particular processes, and are then available for other process participants to review as required. 

6. Appian BPM suite offers **Mobile Apps** for iPhone/iPad, Blackberry and Android clients, providing native client applications to interact with the processes. A particularly useful feature is that the user interface only needs to be designed once and is then automatically rendered for each mobile device. 

7. For **Monitoring Prosesses and for Executive Dashboards**, Appian BPM Suite has a Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) component for monitoring process execution and an **in-memory analytics engine** that can be used in-flight to analyse process execution instances in real time. 

8. Appian BPM Suite includes a process execution engine that handles all the runtime needs of the processes. Appian is built to run in a Java J2EE application server environment; Appian packages its BPM suite with JBoss, but can also run on WebSphere and WebLogic platforms. SOA and web services integration needs are handled through the **Appian Smart Services**. Appian repository uses either Oracle RDBMS or SQL Server. 

Here are the author's view of Appian BPM Offerings :-

1. Appian BPM Suite is a **100% web-based** solution, hence provides good usability through consistent look and feel and easy accessibility.

2. Appian BPM Suite offers all the major functionality in a **Single Package** which includes process design, business rules, events, document management, monitoring, analytics and mobile clients.
4. **Versioning** is a strong point for the product. With Appian BPM Suite, just about everything can be versioned, with roll-back capabilities and role or user-based security to control access. Security is fairly standard, with role and user-based authorization and SSL to secure communications.

5. **Dynamic update** is another strong point of Appian BPM Suite. Not only can processes be changed in-flight, but individual executions of the process can be changed dynamically without affecting the way the process runs next time. Further this dynamic updates can be done based on real time information from in-memory analytics makes it very powerful.

6. **Limited Adapters to commercial applications** - Appian BPM only offers a fairly basic range of adapters, covering such applications as major ERP or CRM packages. It does offer Java-based data access services for bringing data into the processes for enrichment or reference purposes, but beyond this there is not much on offer to ease integration with other commercial applications and environments. 

7. **Limited support for Import / export capabilities -** Import / export is relatively limited area of functionality mainly available to user interface and reports. Its limited because Appian has taken proprietary approach to use its own language for rules specification. Further Appian does not support other external Business Rule Management System (BRMS), Business Event Processing (BEP), BAM or Analytics tools, and Appian artefacts cannot be exported to other tools either.

8. Appian BPM Suite relies on its underlying host environments for **Scalability** as it runs on most major Java enterprise application servers. The biggest contribution to performance comes from in-memory analytics engine, but this in itself raises concerns over scalability as they might start to struggle when systems get too heavily loaded.

9. **Limited Process Templates -** Appian has limited supply of process templates. Process Template Packages are essential as it significantly speeds up BPM deployment and value creation. 

<a name="oracle"/></a>
##Oracle BPM
</br>
Oracle has brought together a number of different technologies under its Fusion Middleware brand to deliver its BPM functionality. Here are some of the functional points that Oracle BPM offers :-

1. Oracle supports 2 tools for Process Design, they are **Oracle BPM Studio and Oracle Business Process Composer**. Studio is primarily targeted to technical people to design a BPM flow, integration activities, simulation and the deployment of the process design. Composer is a web-based tool and is primarily targeted at business users. The unification comes from the fact that the two tools store Process Design artefacts in the Oracle BPM asset repository. So a process flow that has been designed in Composer by business user can be used by technical people and viceversa. 

2. **Oracle Business Rules** tool is to create Business Rules and can be managed directly from the Composer. An important point to note, however, is that rules cannot be created with the Oracle Composer; they must be built with Oracle Business Rules.

3. All Process Design artefacts can be versioned as well as collaborated through **Oracle WebCenter Portal** which offers role-based security and personalized web based UI interface to allow the process participants to provide their own feedback on the process design. Oracle’s role-based governance mechanisms enables versions to be managed by the administrator, allowing roll-back to previous versions and incorporating change management. 

4. For higher level modelling and process analysis at the corporate level, Oracle offers the **Oracle Business Process Analysis (BPA)** Suite but is not part of the Oracle BPM Suite and needs to be licensed separately. 

5. **User Interfaces** such as forms have to be created using the Human Task editor in the Oracle JDeveloper ADF environment. The manual Steps and the user interface can be incorporated into the process design with Composer or Studio.

6. **Oracle Process Workspace** – a role-based or personalized web-based UI interface offers process participants task lists, process status and process dashboards. The process workspace has the added advantage that there are adapters to allow it to hook directly into Microsoft Office environments such as Excel, Word and Outlook. The process workspace provides a particular process participant or role with a view of only the part of the process that is relevant, together with any milestones. This is useful as it conceals the process complexity from end users where it is not relevant to their own activities.

7. Document management related to the process is handled by **Oracle Enterprise Content Manager**. Content Manager provides comprehensive content management facilities including storage, security, meta-data tagging and organization of content. Content can be attached to the process so that process participants can see it and take note as they carry out their assigned tasks.

8. In terms of integration infrastructure, all of the SOA-based integration activity is carried out by the **Oracle SOA Suite** components which include **Oracle Service Bus** (the Oracle ESB) and a range of adapters to different applications and environments. Composite SOA components and web services can be packaged up in the Oracle SOA Suite and made available in the Oracle BPM Studio for inclusion into the overall process design and flow. 

9. **Oracle BAM** provides a full range of business activity monitoring facilities for monitoring processes and reporting through dashboards.

Following are the author's view of Oracle BPM Offerings :-

1. Oracle BPM offers **Multiple tools for Process Design**, they are Oracle BPM Studio and Oracle Business Process Composer. The Composer is primarily intended for Business Users. While the Studio is intended for developers to build on the initial process design done on Composer and implement the necessary technical components and integration. There is also an additional tool for Process Participants to collaborate using Process Workspace. All the 3 tools are based on roles, which adds usability but sometimes due to interchangeability of the tools can cause problems.

2. On the **Integration** front, Oracle provides a range of adapters within its Oracle SOA Suite, and these can be leveraged by Oracle BPM by plugging them into the process design flow. Oracle offers adapters to its own applications and SAP, as well as a number of legacy environments such as IBM’s CICS application system.

3. **Import/export** facilities are good between the different Oracle environments. As seen in point 1 the process design can be shared across multiple tools. Also the Integration Adapters built in the Oracle SOA Suite can be reused in the process design environments. In addition, Oracle’s use of standards ensures wider third-party import/export capabilities.

4. Oracle is able to leverage the extensive functionality in its WebLogic Java application server environment, enabling high levels of **Scalability and Availability**. 

5. Oracle BPM suite is built on **Standards**. Process design is BPMN 2.0 compliant, and XPDL can also be used to pass models around between different tools. Portal products can pick up the JSF-compliant web-based user interfaces for display. Artefacts can be imported and exported between most components in industry standard formats. Even at the lower levels, Oracle supports a wide range of SOA and web services standards too for integration purposes. 

6. **Limited Usability of Human Task -** The human task flow doesn't seem to fit  comfortably with the Oracle business process design. This is because User Interface for human workflow is separate from the process design tools. 

7. **Limitation of Dynamic Process Change -** There is also a limited capability to change the processes dynamically; although the process definitions can be changed. Process Composer does enable business rules to be altered at runtime, offering a degree of flexibility. 

8. **Complicated Oracle packaging -** Users will need to completely understand what licenses they will need to purchase in order to properly evaluate Oracle offerings. 

9. **Limited Process Templates -** Pre-packaged Process Definitions for particular industry or cross-industry process provides users faster time-to-value as users can customize the template and deploy the process much more quickly. In case of Oracle, they offer many different industry and cross-industry solutions with its own licensing and hence do not supply any process templates

<a name="ibm"/></a>
## IBM BPM
</br>
IBM has been involved in BPM for a number of years, with its solutions being a natural extension of the underlying WebSphere-based SOA platform. The new IBM Business Process Manager represents the merging of the WebSphere Process Server BPM capabilities with the Lombardi technology, the company IBM acquired. IBM’s approach to BPM is focused around the process, and this is reinforced by the substantial pool of template processes it has assembled across a wide range of industries. The key components that make up the IBM BPM Offerings are :- 
</br>
### Process Designer 

This is one of the two Process Design Tool that IBM Provides. The other being Integration Developer. Here are the salient features of this Process Design Tool

1. Process Designer is the BPMN-based **Process Modelling Tool** for building business processes. 
2. Process Designer is meant for **Business Users** such as business analysts and process designers. 
3. **Forms and User Interface Specifications** are also supported in Process Designer. Forms are automatically generated from the process flow so that they can either be used immediately for testing, or can be customized to produce the most suitable format for end users. 
4. The process design tool also supports the authoring and editing of **Business Rules** based on JRules format that will be actioned in process execution. 
5. For **Process Monitoring**, Process Designer generates the monitoring models necessary for run-time monitoring of BPMN processes together with reporting and analysis facilities, including executive dashboards, bottleneck ‘heatmaps’ and scoreboards.

### Integration Developer 

This is the other Process Design Tool meant for technical IT staff. Integration Developer is the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) based tool for designing SOA service and back-end orchestration at the application to application level. The key integration between the two design tool is that the process flow designed in the Integration Developer can be plugged into the processes created with Process Designer. Integration Developer is additionally used to define and assemble SOA services and record in Process Center.
</br>
### Process Center 

Process Center component provides a number of powerful facilities to aid in process design. </br>They are :- 

1. Process Center is the IBM Business Process Manager **Asset Repository** where all process activity is stored including the Business Rules, and from where processes are deployed.
2. Various created components like integration flows generated by Integration Designer can be placed in **Toolkits** with-in Process Center and can be shared with other users across multiple different process design projects.
3. Process Center also allows all the artefacts related to one project to be gathered together in one **Workspace** which can be shared between multiple users. 
4. Process Center enables Process Designer to provide a **Unified Authoring Environment** for process designs where multiple participants can collaborate on individual process design. A key point about this **Collaborative Editing** facility is that it is based on library merge capabilities rather than check-in/check-out; as a result, all participants can freely edit the process as required without waiting for someone else to put the model back before making changes. 
5. Process Center provides **Snapshot Facility** where in the designer can take the current process design and all the related artefacts and set it as the new version on which further work can take place.
6. Process Center supports both **Process Replay and Simulation**. The replay function allows a process designer to immediately try the part of the process that is currently being developed to check if it is correct, and then the full process can be simulated with varying degrees of load. 
7. **Versioning** support is all managed and governed from Process Center and allows Roll Backward and Forward Capability through the different versions to make comparisons. 

### IBM Process Server 

At run-time, BPM processing for both BPMN and BPEL flows is carried out by IBM Process Server. This BPM engine runs within a WebSphere application server, and handles execution of all the deployed processes. IBM Process Server provides access to the integration infrastructure, process monitoring, events processing and rules execution. Process Server includes a wide range of adapters to different packages and back-end systems, and these can be brought into the flow through the Integration Developer.

### IBM Business Process Manager 

IBM Business Process Manager supports a range of standards, with BPMN 2.0 for process modelling and exchange, and SOA standards like WS-Security for lower-level integrations. This also provides federated task list support that offers visibility across all process participants.</br>
</br>

Following are the author's view on IBM BPM Offerings :-

1. The decoupling of Process Designer and Integration Developer ensures that business users designing processes with Process Designer can hand off any technical integration work needed to the development teams, and then pick up and plug in the resulting artefact that will have been created by the developers with Integration Developer. 

2. Usability is benefited by the single Process Centre asset repository for all design time and run-time needs, handling all process and SOA services assets and providing better overall project visibility and opportunities for reuse.

3. Process Designer uses layered approach to provides all the functionality expected in a BPM design tool, such as swim lanes, forms creation, BPMN models and drag-and-drop facilities. This avoids complexity, where in the average process designer is offered a simplified environment, with the additional layers of functionality accessible through individual properties.

4. Process Center allows Collaborative editing facility, it is based on library merge capabilities rather than check-in/check-out; as a result, all participants can freely edit the process as required without waiting for someone else to put the model back before making changes. 

5. Process Center holds all the process-related assets, and the same repository is used for both design time and run-time needs, hence deployment is easy and fast.  In fact, a new process can be deployed with a single click. 

6. IBM uses an What is Open Service Gateway Initiative (OSGi) based deployment model, so the process is deployed in a package together with all related data and rules definitions. 

7. Time to Value because of single Process Center Concept. Further Process Server include many ready-made adapters which improves delivery time considerably, since developing these integration interfaces from scratch can take an inordinately long time.  

8. IBM Process Server executes the business processes under WebSphere Application Server. Hence process execution is benefited from the extensive ‘mission critical’ characteristics of this environment. This includes handling transactional integrity and security for all process executions, running in high availability clusters,  scalability and providing a range of recovery facilities such as automatic retries, compensating transactions and store-and-forward communications. 

9. IBM offers a wide range of industry specific and generic process templates together with assets such as documentation and guidance. 

10. IBM Cloud platform 'Blueworks Live', provides an environment where users across the world can collaborate on process discovery and design through forums, bulletin boards, access to template libraries and other social networking facilities. Further IBM also offers process automation in the Cloud through Blueworks, which is mainly targeted at lightweight processes common in many companies such as on-boarding a new employee or booking travel.

[Part5]: https://raw.github.com/NarayanMahadevan/MakeTechEzResources/master/images/GK_EnterpriseArchPlan/GK_BPM_Part5.png "BPM In Action"     
-->
</br>  

BPM In Action takes a look at some of the use cases of BPM. For every use case it specifies the Business Problem, the participants in the Business Process, new BPM Process and the Benefits of using BPM. Here are the list of uses cases :- 

1. [**BPM for Insurance Claims**](#bpm_ins_claims)
2. [**BPM for Loan Applications**](#bpm_loan_appln)
3. [**BPM for Employee Onboarding**](#bpm_emp_onboard)

</br>
<a name="bpm_ins_claims"/></a>
### BPM for Insurance Claims
</br>
**Business Problem:** 60% of a claims handler’s time is spent coordinating work done by other people in the network, often contractors outside the company. Contractor enrolment and KPI management is difficult to monitor. Client satisfaction is negatively impacted by claims completion process delays. 

**Process Participants:** Customers, Contractors, Claims Management Department, Finance department

**BPM Process Improvement:** The following are the Process Steps: 

1. Claims are first entered into a BPM Process and routed to appropriate stakeholders for review
2. When approved, the claim goes to the contractor network 
3. The right contractor for the work is assigned, and throughout the repair process, Claim Management Department organize audits to check workflow, quality, and resources to ensure standards are maintained 
4. Contractor reports from the field preferably through Mobile Apps or using Internet, with information going directly into the BPM system 
5. The BPM System sends appropriate status alerts to internal departments and to customers. 
6. Upon job completion, all data is sent to Finance for invoicing and to close out the claim. 

**BPM Process Benefits:** The benefits using BPM system in Claim Process is that there is a clear process visibility and control - to guarantee that the right contractor is assigned, that the repair workflow proceeds smoothly, that service quality meets high standards, and that proper internal and customer reporting occurs at every stage. 

</br>
<a name="bpm_loan_appln"/></a>
### BPM for Loan Applications
</br>
**Business Problem:** Lending processes involves credit evaluation, underwriting, fulfilment, and monitoring between discrete department. Manual and paper-based processes to collect all customer related information for developing loan documentation and then processing the requests is cumbersome and inefficient. Hence causes delay with no clear visibility or accountability 

**Process Participants:** Loan agents and officers,bank resources from credit evaluation, underwriting, fulfilment, and Senior Management 

**BPM Process Improvement:** The following are the Process Steps :- 

1. Customer applies for a loan using standardized forms created using BPM System
2. A BPM platform with an integrated document management system integrates all customer interactions and related customers documents across all products. The system automates the creation of the highly-detailed loan application binder that the customer receives. 
3. The BPM System executes Business Rules for risk analysis using the application binder and information gathered from other IT applications. 
4. Based on the score BPM System assist in resource assignments for given tasks.
5. The movement of the application through the approval system up until fulfilment is automated through monitored hands-of application between employees across department ensuring speedy and timely decision. 

**BPM Process Benefits:** The benefits using BPM system in Loan Applications is following:
1. Loan Application Process which are predominantly paper based, with BPM System  is automated through monitored hands-of application between employees. 
2. BPM increased efficiency by the ability to track applications through the entire loan approval system. 
3. Customers not only have clear visibility of the status but also since it frees up the agents, they also receive additional time and attention from their agents.

#  
<a name="bpm_emp_onboard"/></a>
### BPM for Employee Onboarding
</br>
**Business Problem:** New hire on-boarding is a cross-functional, time-consuming, and often highly-manual process. It needs coordination within departments and to facilitate the process hand-offs between departments. 

**Process Participants:** Recruiting, Human Resources, Finance, Executive Management, Department Supervisors, IT, New Hire 

**BPM Process Improvement:** The process kicks of on Recruitment, where in the  information flows from HR Recruitment to HR for automatic pre-processing, which kicks out sub-processes for things such as all IT provisioning, delivering new-hire paperwork, alerting Finance for benefits processing, and scheduling an introductory Supervisor meeting. These steps further triggers the follow on processes, such as filing final paperwork, creating employee photos, badges and business cards, alerting the intranet team to post new information in the employee directory, and getting the new hire into People Management system. 

**BPM Process Benefits:** Tremendous reduction in time and effort required to process new hires, and ensure that all keys steps are completed. The end result is that employees are up and running faster.

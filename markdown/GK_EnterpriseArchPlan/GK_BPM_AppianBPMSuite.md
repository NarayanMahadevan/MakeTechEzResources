# Appian BPM

Appian is one of the new players on the BPM block. Founded in 1999, it has only just finished its first decade, but in this time it has established itself as a pure play BPM solution provider. Common themes running through all Appian’s offerings are the 100% browser-based nature. It provides solution for on-premise as-well-ass cloud deployment. The Appian BPM Suite consists of a whole range of different functions and components, but with a few exceptions they all come in a single package. The single package includes all the associated capabilities such as process design, business rules, events, content management, monitoring, analytics and mobile clients. Here are some of the functional points that Appian offers:

1. For process modelling, Appian offers **Appian Process Modeler** which is a 100% web-based tool supporting BPMN-style process flow design and specification.

2. Appian BPM offers **Role-based Security** for controlled access and **Full Versioning** for controlled change and **Role-back** capabilities to just about everything. Thus Rules, processes, smart services, document – all can be versioned to manage change effectively with controlled access. 

3. Appian’s support for **Business Rules and Business Events** is also built into the single-package Appian BPM Suite. Rules and events are specified through a web-based menu-style interface, and can be validated before deployment. The rules and events are stored in a proprietary language in the Appian repository.

4. Appian offers two routes to handling user interface needs – forms and portals
   a. **Forms -** The Appian Forms Designer is a web-based tool that provides a menu-driven means of building a user interface display. Appian Forms Designer also supports the ability to map PDF, HTML and JSP format forms to Appian BPM forms. Once the Appian form is built, it is stored as an artefact and can now be drag and dropped as required into the process flow. 
   b. **Portals -** Portal support is more applicable to the idea of providing a user or role with a personalized workspace. Portal dashboards are built using a point and click style of interface under a web-based tool. <p></p>

5. Appian BPM Suite supports **Document Management** in conjunction with its BPM processes. Documents can be stored and tagged with metadata and tied to a particular processes, and are then available for other process participants to review as required. 

6. For use in a **Mobile Environment**, Appian offers support for iPhone/iPad, Blackberry and Android clients, providing native client applications to interact with the processes. A particularly useful feature is that the user interface only needs to be designed once and is then automatically rendered for each mobile device. If third parties want to create their own implementations for other mobile devices then Appian offers a full branding package too.

7. For **Monitoring and Executive Dashboards**, Appian BPM Suite has a Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) component for monitoring process execution and an **in-memory analytics engine** that can be used in-flight to analyse process execution instances in real time. 

8. Appian BPM Suite includes a process execution engine that handles all the runtime needs of the processes. Appian is built to run in a Java J2EE application server environment; Appian packages its BPM suite with JBoss, but can also run on WebSphere and WebLogic platforms. SOA and web services integration needs are handled through the **Appian Smart Services**. Appian repository uses either Oracle RDBMS or SQL Server. 

Here are the pros and cons of Appian BPM Offerrings. Lets look at some of the pros first

1. The fact that all tools are **100% web-based**, hence it offers a level of usability because it provides consistency and accessibility.

2. Appian BPM Suite offers all the major functionality in a **Single Package** which includes process design, business rules, events, document management, monitoring, analytics and mobile clients.

3. The biggest time-to-value contributor offered by Appian BPM Suite is the support for **Social BPM**. Once the process has been defined and the user interfaces set up, the collaborative nature of process interaction combined with the ease of access from within social networking feeds or through the packaged mobile native clients makes getting end users up to speed and productive much easier and quicker. 
4. **Versioning** is a strong point for the product though. With Appian BPM Suite, just about everything can be versioned, with roll-back capabilities and role or user-based security to control access. Security is fairly standard, with role and user-based authorization and SSL to secure communications.

5. **Dynamic update** is another strong point of Appian BPM Suite. Not only can processes be changed in-flight, but individual executions of the process can be changed dynamically without affecting the way the process runs next time. Further the combination of in-memory analytics tool that can produce information in real time which can then be used to dynamically change operations makes it very powerful.

Here are some of the limitations in Appian BPM offerrings:

1. **Limited Adapters to commercial applications** - Appian BPM only offers a fairly basic range of adapters, covering such applications as major ERP or CRM packages. It does offer Java-based data access services for bringing data into the processes for enrichment or reference purposes, but beyond this there is not much on offer to ease integration with other commercial applications and environments. 

2. **Limited support for Import / export capabilities -** Import / export is relatively limited area of functionality mainly available to user interface and reports. Its limited because Appian has taken proprietary approach to use its own language for rules specification. Further Appiean does not support other external Busines Rule Mnagament System (BRMS), Business Event Processing (BEP), BAM or Analytics tools, and Appian artefacts cannot be exported to other tools either.

3. Appian BPM Suite relies on its underlying host environments for **Scalability** as it runs on most major Java enterprise application servers. The biggest contribution to performance comes from in-memory analytics engine, but this in itself raises concerns over scalability as they might start to struggle when systems get too heavily loaded.

4. **Limited Process Templates -** Appian does limited supply of process templates to cover specific needs of its prime Federal Government market, targeted at HR and Accounting needs. These Process Template Packages significantly speed up solution deployment and value creation.

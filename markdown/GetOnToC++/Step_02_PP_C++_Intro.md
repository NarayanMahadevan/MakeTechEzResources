# Step 2: &nbsp;Practice Programs
</br>

- PP1 :- &nbsp;Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers, obtains the numbers from the user, then prints the larger number followed by the words "is larger." If the numbers are equal, print the message "These numbers are equal."

- PP2 :- &nbsp; Write a program that reads in five integers and determinesand prints the largest and the smallest integers in the group. Use only the programming techniques you learned in this chapter.

- PP3 :- &nbsp; Write a program that reads an integer and determines and prints whether it’s odd or even. (Hint: Use the modulus operator. An even number is a multiple of two. Any multiple of two leaves a remainder of zero when divided by 2).

- PP4 :- &nbsp; Write a program that reads in two integers and determines and prints if the first is a multiple of the second or vice-versa. (Hint: Use the modulus operator).

- PP5 :- &nbsp; Create a BMI calculator application that reads the user’s weight in pounds and height in inches (or, if you prefer, the user’s weight in kilograms and height in meters), then calculates and displays the user’s body mass index. Also Display Underweight, Normal, Over Weight, etc based on the rule shown below 


		BMI = (weightInPounds × 703) / (heightInInches × heightInInches)
									OR
		BMI = weightInKilograms / (heightInMeters × heightInMeters)
		
		Underweight : less than 18.5
		Normal:      between 18.5 and 24.9		Overweight:  between 25 and 29.9		Obese:       30 or greater

- PP6 :- &nbsp; Write a Program to Find Number of Digits in a Integer

- PP7 :- &nbsp; A palindrome is a number or a text phrase that reads the same backward as forward. For example, each of the following five-digit integers is a palindrome: 12321, 55555, 45554 and 11611. Write a program that reads in a five-digit integer and determines whether it’s a palindrome. (Hint: Use the division and modulus operators to separate the number into its individ- ual digits).
- PP8 :- &nbsp; (Sides of a Triangle) Write a program that reads three nonzero double values and determines and prints whether they could represent the sides of a triangle.
- PP9 :- &nbsp; (Sides of a Right Triangle) Write a program that reads three nonzero integers and deter- mines and prints whether they’re the sides of a right triang
- PP10 :- &nbsp; (Factorial) The factorial of a nonnegative integer n is written n! (pronounced “n factorial”) and is defined as follows:
		n!=n·(n–1)·(n–2)·...·1 (for values of n greater than 1)		and 		n!=1 (forn=0orn=1)		For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
	- Write a program that reads a nonnegative integer and computes and prints its factorial.
	- Write a program that estimates the value of the mathematical constant e by using the formula: (Prompt the user for the desired accuracy of e (i.e., the number of terms in the summa-tion).
		e = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + …

# Step 3: &nbsp;Practice Programs
</br>

- PP1 :- &nbsp;Write a program that calculates cube of a number as user input to demonstrate the scope (either function scope, global namespace scope or function-prototype scope) of each of the following elements: 
   - The global variable x.
   - The variable y in main.
   - The function cube
   - Inline function cube
   - Macro to calculate cube
   - calculate cube for x and y using the function, inline and macro to calculate cube in the main function
   - The function prototype for cube.
   - The identifier y in the function prototype for cube.
   
- PP2 :- &nbsp;Write a program that tests all the math library function calls discussed in section 2 of step 3 and print the results. Use the same values as shown in the figure of Math Library Functions Part 1 and 2. 

- PP3 :- &nbsp;Write a Program that calls the function hypotenuse that takes two double-precision, floating-point arguments, side1 and side2, and returns a double-precision, floating-point result which is the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle. Hypotenuse is side opposite the right angle in a right-angled triangle. Refer the [**MathIsFun Site**](http://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/hypotenuse.html) for more details.

- PP4 :- &nbsp;Write a Program that calls the function to find the triangle is a right-angle triangle given the length of 3 sides of a triangle. Make sure to write a Function Prototype to take-in 3 floating point argumnets as user inputs and return a boolean. Refer the [**MathIsFun Site**](http://www.mathsisfun.com/pythagoras.html) for more details.

- PP5 :- &nbsp; Write a Program that calls the function to find the the diagonal of a Square or a Rectangle given their sides.

- PP6 :- &nbsp; Write a Program that calls the functions to find the the Perimeter and Area of a triangle. Write two different functions for Perimeter and Area. Perimeter takes sides as argument while Area takes Base and Hight as arguments. Refer the [**MathIsFun Site**](http://www.mathsisfun.com/triangle.html) for more details.

- PP7 :- &nbsp; Write a Program using functions that takes in the 3 sides of a triangle and determines if it is in-deed a triangle. Note that for a triangle any 2 sides is always greater then the 3 side. 

- PP8 :- &nbsp; Write a program that prompts the user for the radius of a sphere, and calculates and prints the volume of that sphere. Use an inline function sphereVolume that returns the result - The volume of the sphere is calculated as $$$ \frac43\pi r^3$$$

- PP9 :- &nbsp; **(Parking Charges)** A parking garage charges a $2.00 minimum fee to park for up to three hours. The garage charges an additional $0.50 per hour for each hour or part thereof in excess of three hours. The maximum charge for any given 24-hour period is $10.00. Assume that no car parks for longer than 24 hours at a time. Write a program that calculates and prints the parking charges for each of three customers who parked their cars in this garage yesterday. You should enter the hours parked for each customer. Your program should print the results in a neat tabular format and should calculate and print the total of yesterdayâ€™s receipts. The program should use the function calculateCharges to determine the charge for each customer. Your outputs should appear in the following format:

		Car      Hours		Charge		1          1.5		  2.00		2          4.0		  2.50		3         24.0		 10.00		TOTAL     29.5		 14.50- PP10 :- &nbsp; **(Rounding Numbers)** Function floor can be used to round a number to a specific decimal place. The statement 
		y = floor( x * 10 + .5 ) / 10; // rounds x to the tenths position
		y = floor( x * 100 + .5 ) / 100; // rounds x to the hundredths position		
   Write a program that defines four functions to round a number x in various ways:
	a. roundToInteger( number )
	b. roundToTenths( number )
	c. roundToHundredths( number ) 
	d. roundToThousandths( number ) <p></p>
   For each value read, your program should print the original value, the number rounded to the nearest integer, the number rounded to the nearest tenth, the number rounded to the nearest hun- dredth and the number rounded to the nearest thousandth.

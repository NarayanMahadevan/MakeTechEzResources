# Step 1: &nbsp;Practice Programs
</br>

- PP1 :- &nbsp;Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, obtains the two numbers from the user and prints the sum, product, difference, and quotient of the two numbers.

- PP2 :- &nbsp;Write a program that prints the numbers 1 to 4 on the same line with each pair of adjacent numbers separated by one space. Do this several ways:   a. Using one statement with one stream insertion operator.   b. Usingonestatementwithfourstreaminsertionoperators.
   c. Using four statements. <p></p>
- PP3 :- &nbsp;Write a program that inputs three integers from the key- board and prints the sum, average, product, smallest and largest of these numbers.

- PP4 :- &nbsp;Write a program that reads in the radius of a circle as an integer and prints the circle’s diameter, circumference ( 2 * π  * radius) and area. Use the constant value 3.14159 for π. Do all calculations in output statements.

- PP5 :- &nbsp;Write a program that prints a box, an oval, an arrow and a diamond as follows:

- PP6 :- &nbsp; Create an application that calculates your daily driving cost, so that you can estimate how much money could be saved by car pooling, which also has other advantages such as reducing carbon emissions and reducing traffic congestion. The application should input the following information and display the user’s cost per day of driving to work:
		a) Total miles driven per day.		b) Costpergallonofgasoline.		c) Average miles per gallon.		d) Parkingfeesperday.		e) Tolls per day.

- PP7 :- &nbsp; Write a program that reads the radius of a circle (as a double value) and computes and prints the diameter, the circumference and the area. Use the value 3.14159 for π.
